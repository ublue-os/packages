  # Used to determine to which namespace the copr gets pushed to
  # when merging to main branch.
  # Example:
  # ```yaml
  # - job:
  #     trigger: commit
  #     branch: main
  #     owner: "@zeglius"
  #     project: packages
  # ```
  # The above config will push to '@zeglius/packages' namespace
  # in fedora copr.

  #      project: staging
  #    bazzite: &project-bazzite
  #      owner: "@bazzite-org"
