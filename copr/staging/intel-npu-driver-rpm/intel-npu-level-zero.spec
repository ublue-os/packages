%description
This is the user space driver for the Intel NPU device. It allows the use
of the Intel NPU via the Level Zero API.

The Intel NPU device is an AI inference accelerator integrated with Intel
client CPUs, starting from the Intel Core Ultra generation of CPUs (CPUs
formerly known as Meteor Lake). It enables energy-efficient execution of
artificial neural network tasks.

Note that while this device is officially called the Neural Processing Unit,
the Linux kernel driver uses the previous name of Versatile Processing Unit
(VPU).

Tests for the Intel NPU Driver for Linux.

These programs exercise the kernel-mode (kmd) and user-mode (umd) parts of
the driver.

%changelog
* Wed Jan 1 2025 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.10.1-1
- Uprev to latest upstream version.
- Upstream moved firmware file from LFS into repo, so that eliminates some workarounds.
* Sat Nov 9 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.10.0-3
- Fix copr import (build should be fine) by unconditionally specifying patchfiles.
* Fri Nov 8 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.10.0-2
- Whoops, need to patch the extension headers if building against OneAPI Level Zero >= 1.8
- Apparently they have not tested this since GCC correctly errors out with a type mismatch
  because of the change, so patch the driver to fix the bug.
* Fri Nov 8 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.10.0-1
- Update package to the latest released version.
- Allows us to drop a substantial number of patches, including one downstream, yay!
- Requires us to uprev bundled packages and some dependencies.
* Wed Sep 25 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.8.0-2
- Update the package to the latest upstream patch, not yet in any release.
- It is just a fix to a documented option we aren't using, but still.
* Wed Sep 18 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.8.0-1
- Add some additional documentation files to the package.
- Update the package to the latest upstream release & patch.
* Wed Aug 14 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.6.0-2
- Whoops, sources file has special semantics.
* Wed Aug 14 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.6.0-1
- Update package to latest upstream release.
- Bump minimum dependency versions where upstream's preferred version is now in Fedora.
* Tue Jul 9 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.1-1
- Update to latest upstream release.
* Thu Jul 4 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.0-5
- Revert firmware location change, it seems like a deeper bug
- Attempt to also own the other directories that we install like /lib/firmware/updates/intel (etc)
* Thu Jul 4 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.0-4
- Fix dracut not picking up the NPU/VPU firmware
- Fix a typo in the firmware patch name
* Mon Jul 1 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.0-3
- Fix vpu_37xx_v0.0.bin being a Git LFS pointer, replace it with the real blob
* Mon Jul 1 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.0-2

* Sun Jun 30 2024 Alexander F. Lent <lx@xanderlent.com> - 1.5.0-1
